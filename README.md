# 2077_instant_vendor_refresh
immediate refresh of vendor items (non iconic  / quest items)
<pre>

-1.0 release-
  -First version of this mod does not allow for user to control when the window refreshes. This will be added in a future release
  
-Please Note-
  -This mod currently removes the ability to buy back sold items. this means that selling an iconic weapon to the shop will make it un recoverable. 
    Keep this in mind when using this mod. 
    
-Planned updates-
  -Update to allow user to determine interval of refresh
  -I will be updating this soon to only instantly refresh items commonly purchased in bulk 
    I.E. Ammo, Grenades, stims, and crafting Materials
